foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you internet or Google come as a handy support a backup so if you do not know what to do or how to respond you can rely on them but in real life real time situations that doesn't happen you cannot depend on Google to respond to someone who is standing right in front of you right right so this is something you must be cautious of it's It's a phenomena widely experienced technology cannot be a substitute for real life interaction and planned statements or responses can never carry the authenticity of something that is spontaneous um communication through text appears safer but is also duller it does not carry the warmth and liveliness of a face-to-face thing and it can become a habit to hide behind text right do not let that become a habit that habit simply means fear do not protect fear if there is something that cannot be said face to face ask yourself does it deserve to be said in writing huh the same phone that you use to text people can also be used to talk and it's not as if texting necessarily saves time you can get into an endless exchange of text messages and that can go on for two hours does that not happen text and when you are not texting you are waiting for the others text and WhatsApp is showing Rajiv is typing and you're waiting here what is the typing what is the typing what is he typing even before he has pressed the send button you are already Shadow Boxing you have already come up with five possible options this is what you might be writing and if he writes this I'll reply this way how is that saving time please tell me there can be instances when text can save time yes obviously so you don't want to go through the entire process of ringing someone up and it's not worth it so simply write two words and get done with it so that is all okay but if a matter can be finished off in two minutes five minutes directly by conversing that with that person either face to face or on call what is the need to hide behind text similarly what is the need to hide behind knowledge external knowledge I mean Google Knowledge those who have known have said that you know only when you live your knowledge is your knowledge only if you are living that knowledge if knowing does not become being then there is no knowing um knowing must turn into being it can Google Knowledge turn into your being you can quickly Google something and spit out the fact or the information and be done with it it will not become your life it will not get into the depth of your mind won't help much use technology to your advantage do not use it to handicap yourself technology must be used to do what you cannot do technology must not become a substitute for what you already can healthily do if I have the benefit of Technology what should I develop for myself a car or a crutch crutch you understand what is scratch huh the things that you use to assist yourself in walking basaki now you have these two feet already but they cannot take you at 60 kmph so let technology give you a car the car is furthering your power now it is furthering your ability these two legs cannot take you beyond the speed instead if you use technology to develop very Advanced crutches with AI and feel proud of it what have you done to yourself instead of augmenting the capacity of the legs you have debilitated the legs maybe with your legs you were able to go at least at 10 kmph now with the assistance of Technology you are going at 2 kmph now that brings us back to the fundamental question of who is the user of Technology and that's where internal Liberation lies no technology will be of use if you are internally not free not luminous whatsoever is given to you you will use it to your own disadvantage you have heard the old story of the monkey with the sword right those were bygone times so all that the monkey could have was a sword but these are times of advanced technology the monkey can have an ICBM tipped with a nuclear weapon what will the monkey do the monkey has been given great technology what will the monkey use it for the same thing that his ancestral monkey used it for what was the sword used for the monkey was given the sword actually he picked it up hmm did he use it for any creative purpose if we remain monkeys Within whatsoever comes to us Powers rights knowledge technology we will use it to our own detriment our own destruction but we don't understand this we think just because we have something it is for the better no not necessarily it all depends on who you are and that's the central vedantic question who are you if you are not right whatsoever you have will be just wrong for you first of all you have to be right Within and then whatever you have can be used rightly hmm you go back to the epics the you think of all the classical villains duryodhan AKA ship they had a lot no ravan was the superpower of his times Lanka of gold so much Weaponry as well and he had a lot of knowledge too no hirana had a lot he had been gifted with blessings was so powerful the question is what were these people using their power and knowledge and money for were they villains because they didn't have anything why are they still remembered as the topmost Baddies why because they didn't have much no they had a lot but were operating whatever they had from a bad Center so it's the center Within that means everything if the center is false then all technological progress will simply mean climate change Extinction of species actually the sixth mass extinction phase in which we have already entered now this kind of mass extinction could not have happened to the cave man to the ancient man why because he didn't have technology internally we have remained that same old caveman but additionally today that caveman has a lot of technology and Power so he has used that technology that power Just to finish himself off [Music]
