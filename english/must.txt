#must ka use
"dil se salh"
Apko wo movie jaroor dekhni chiye = You must watch that movie
Apko marne se phle ye jarour karna chiye = you must do (xyz) at least once before die
 
sound like a boss- give instruction
you must learn to come on time
you must learn to be more careful
you "must not keep in touch" with him
if you do not mind could i suggest something i thing you must not live beyond your mean(aukat se jayada mat kharch kro)
I must get home before it gets dark(adhera hone se phle mujhe gher pauchna hai)
Once you begin, you must continue
you must keep an eye on your children.

#to give emphases to an opinion
I must admit,you work so hard
I must admit, i did not like you that much at first

#jarour aisa hoga -assumptions/Certainity
He must be over fifity
You must be hungry
It must be expensive
